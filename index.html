        <h2>Image Of The Day</h2>
        <h3>Hubble Views an Active Star-Forming Galaxy</h3>
         <p >This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features IC 3476, a dwarf galaxy that lies about 54 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. While this image does not look very dramatic – we might say it looks almost serene – the actual physical events taking place in IC 3476 are highly energetic. In fact, the little galaxy is undergoing a process called ram pressure stripping that is driving unusually high levels of star formation in regions of the galaxy.</p>

    <h2>Missions</h2>
    <h4>Science Missions</h4>
    <p> Peering into the creation of the universe and traversing Mars

        The James Webb Space Telescope is an orbiting infrared observatory that will look to the beginning of time and to hunt for the unobserved formation of the first galaxies, as well as to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today.
        
        Much closer to home, NASA has sent five robotic vehicles, called rovers, to Mars. Rovers help scientists in their quest to understand what different parts of the planet are made of.</p>

        <h2> Why Go to Space?</h2>
        <p> Human space exploration helps to address fundamental questions about our place in the universe and the history of our solar system.</p>
        <p>NASA’s exploration vision is anchored in providing value for humanity by answering some of the most fundamental questions: Why are we here? How did it all begin? Are we alone? What comes next?</p>

        <h2>Our Changing Planet</h2>
        <p>For more than 50 years, NASA satellites have provided data on Earth's land, water, air, temperature, and climate. NASA's Earth Information Center allows visitors to see how our planet is changing in six key areas: sea level rise and coastal impacts, health and air quality, wildfires, greenhouse gases, sustainable energy, and agriculture.</p>
